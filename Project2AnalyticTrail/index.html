<h1>Does importance of religion affect human values?</h1>
<h2 >IVIS17 Project 2 - Visualizing data from World Values Survey</h2>
<br>

<h2>Analytic trail 1 - Using WVS-tools</h2>
<p>
30 countries spread over the planet were selected in order to get a global perspective of the research question stated in the header.
</p> 
<img src="Choose 30 countries.PNG" align="middle" >

<p>
Data was collected from the last 20 years, from 1995 to 2014.
</p>

<p>
The variable "Important in life: Religion" was selected first as a reference to which the other 7 variables:<br>
- Justifiable: Abortion<br>
- Justifiable: Homosexuality<br>
- Justifiable: Divorce<br>
- Justifiable: Euthanasia<br>
- Justifiable: Suicide<br>
- Satisfaction with life<br>
- Freedom of choice and control aver own life<br>
 would be compared with.
</p>

<p>
The WVS tool showing importance of religion as bars for each country was used for visualization of the survey data.
</p>
<img src="Religion bars.PNG" align="middle">

<p>
The bars indicated that religion is important to most of thpeople living in Algeria, Ghana, Tunisia and Egypt. People living in China, Japan, Netherlands and Sweden don't believe religion is that important.
</p>

<p>
The other 7 variables were analyzed by looking at each bar chart. 
</p>

<h2>Analytic trail 2 - Using D3</h2>

<p>To get a better understanding of the relations between importance of religion and the other 7 variables, an interactive visualization tool using parallel coordinates was constructed with D3.<br>
</p>

<p>You can find the visualization tool <a href="https://alexortengren.github.io/d3visualization">here</a>.</p>


<p>The WVS data was cleaned in MS Excel in order to construct a spreadsheet with values for each variable and wave.
</p>


<p>The color of the lines are scaled from green to blue with respect to the importance of religion in the country.</p>
<p>By using the brush tool you can easier follow specific countries and groups to compare relations between the variables. The countries with the highest religious importance was brushed</p>
<img src="Brush religion HIGH.JPG">

<p>as well as the countries with the lowest religious importance</p>
<img src="Brush religion LOW.JPG">

<p>These two brushes indicates that people living in countries where religion is important in life are less justifiable to abortion, homosexuality, divorce etc. than people living in who don't think religion is that important. They also tend to be a little less satisfied with their lifes. No clear correlation could be seen between religion and freedom of choice</p>
