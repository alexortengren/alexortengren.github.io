<h1>How does importance of religion impact human values?</h1>
<h2 >IVIS17 Project 2 - Visualizing data from World Values Survey</h2>
<br>

<h2>Analytic trail 1 - Using WVS-tools</h2>
<p>
30 countries spread over the planet were selected in order to get a global perspective of the research question stated in the header.
</p> 
<img src="Choose 30 countries.PNG" align="middle" >

<p>
Data was collected from the last 20 years, from 1995 to 2014.
</p>
<img src="Select waves.jpg" align="middle">

<p>
The variable "Important in life: Religion" was selected first as a reference which the other 7 variables would be compared with.
</p>
<img src="Choose variable.jpg" align="middle">

<p>
Religion is in general important to people living in Algeria, Ghana, Tunisia and Egypt. People living in China, Japan, Netherlands and Sweden don't believe it's that important.
</p>

<p>
Correlations between Religion and the other 7 variables; Abortion, Homosexuality, Suicide, Euthanasia, Divorce, Satisfaction with life and Freedom of chioce was analyzed by looking at each bar chart. 
</p>

<p>
Comparisons between the 4 waves (20 years) was made to analyze changes over time by using the Time series-tool.
</p>

<h2>Analytic trail 2 - Using D3</h2>

<p>To get a better understanding of the correlations between importance of religion and the other 7 variables, a visualization using parallel coordinates was constructed with D3.<br>
</p>

<p>You can find the visualization tool<a href="https://alexortengren.github.io/planets/">HERE</a></p>


<p>The data was cleaned in Excel where MEAN values for each variable and wave was used as values for the variables.
</p>


<p>The color of the lines in the diagram are scaled from green to blue regarding the importance of religion among the population</p>
<p>By using the brush tool you can easier visualize the correlations. This is the countries with the highest religious importance</p>
<img src="Brush religion HIGH.JPG">
<p>and this is the countries with the lowest religious importance</p>
<img src="Brush religion LOW.JPG">

<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>By using the available data and the visualization tools at the WVS webpage, only an indication of how peoples religious believes impact their satisfaction of life and their values could be seen. <br> Correlations occured among most of the countries (with some exceptions) with the highest or lowest value of religous importance and the "Justifiable-variables". The majority of the people living<br> in countries with low religious importance have a in general a positive attitude towards for example Abortion.
